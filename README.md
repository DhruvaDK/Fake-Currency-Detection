# Fake-Currency-Detection
This Project deals with the identification and detection of fake currency from the given sample of  currencies. There are Different traditional strategies and methods are available for fake currency  identification such as based on the colors, width, and serial numbers mentioned. The problem of detecting  the fake currency notes is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the economy. For Human being it is very  difficult to identify fake currencies, so automatic systems for detection of fake currency is important. In  recent years, there has been a surge in the use of deep learning models for detecting counterfeit currency  using image processing. In the present work a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used for  detecting fake currency notes. To train the model, we use a dataset of images containing both genuine and  fake currency notes of different denominations. The dataset is pre-processed by resizing all images to a fixed  size and normalizing the pixel values. The pre-processed images are then split into training and validation sets  for training and testing the model, respectively. This project aims to model CNN for automatic feature  extraction and classification. The results validate from the proposed model is expected to effectively  recognizes a real and counterfeit currencies of various denominations with the confidence score.
